💻 Joshua “Digital-Dingle” Berry

Crew Chief Land Surveyor by day — self-taught developer by night.
Learning fast. Building real things.
Trying to be the smartest one in the room < Learning from whoever actually is.

🚀 What I’m About

Turning curiosity into code

Automation, data pipelines, and anything with an API

Building tools that actually do something

Leveling up one green GitHub square at a time

Learning by breaking things, fixing them, then pretending it was intentional

🛠️ What I Build
gobbstopper

My “developer gym” — a repo that never ends.
I use it to practice fundamentals, reinforce structure, build habits, and keep my code clean.

skylink

A secure phone-to-desktop control system built with FastAPI and Tailscale.
Groundwork for future automation projects (and maybe remote cat-feeding one day).

forward-array

A real-time data pipeline for crypto prices and PnL tracking.
Focuses on automation, accuracy, and practical backend development.
