## 💻 Joshua “Digital-Dingle” Berry
Crew Chief Land Surveyor by day — part-time developer by night.  
Learning fast. Building real things.  
Trying to be the smartest one in the room < Learning from whoever actually is.

## 🚀 What I’m About
- Turning curiosity into code  
- Automation, data pipelines, and anything with an API  
- Building tools that actually *do something*  
- Leveling up one green GitHub square at a time  
- Learning by breaking things, fixing them, then pretending it was intentional

## 🛠️ What I Build

### **gobbstopper**
My “developer gym” — a repo that never ends.  
Practicing fundamentals, structure, habits, and clean code.

---

### **skylink**
Secure phone → desktop control system (FastAPI + Tailscale).  
Groundwork for future automation projects.  
One day it might feed my cat remotely.  
Cats can’t feed themselves responsibly… now can they? **mEOW**

---

### **forward-array**
Local crypto market data pipeline.  
Real-time price pulls, PnL tracking, and automated analysis hooks.  
Basically: *mission control for my portfolio.*

---

## 📈 Current Mission
Become the kind of developer who doesn’t just write code —  
**I build systems, pipelines, dashboards, automation, tools…  
things with weight.**

---

## 📍 Based In
Bradenton → Largo → Back again  
*(The Florida triangle of productivity.)*

---

## 🧠 Motto
“You don’t rise to the level of your goals.  
You fall to the level of your systems.”  
So I build systems.

And of course,  
**“Interviews before Termination”** is kewl and gewd.
